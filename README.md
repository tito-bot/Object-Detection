I worked on developing an object detection model to identify various road conditions and turns in images captured from roads in Gilgit. The main objective was to enable the model to detect right turns, left turns, straight roads, and unexpected road conditions, such as landslides.

This project offered valuable experience in data collection, annotation, and the implementation of object detection models, with a focus on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework.
